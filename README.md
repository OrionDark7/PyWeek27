# Six Moves
Six Moves is a 2D Puzzle Game built with Python and Pygame. This Game was an entry for PyWeek 27.

### Running The Game
To run the games source code, you need to have the following dependincies installed:
* Python 2.7 or Python 3
* Pygame 1.9 or newer, preferably 1.9.3.
* PyTMX

If you already have Python installed and you have pip, you can also just install all the requirements from _"requirements.txt"_ using pip.

Once those dependencies are installed, download this repository and run _"main.py"_ from Python. You can do this in the Terminal by typing:

`python main.py`
